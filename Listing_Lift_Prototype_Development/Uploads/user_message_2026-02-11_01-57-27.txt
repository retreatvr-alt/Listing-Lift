I have all the context I need from the conversation summary and the current code files. Let me now compose the complete merged message for DeepAgent.

Here is your **single merged copy-paste message** for DeepAgent with all 4 changes:

## ENHANCEMENT FIX - ALL CHANGES (Merged)

The photo enhancement system has multiple issues: wrong model (gpt-5.1), broken streaming approach, poor quality output, CORS errors on enhanced images, Edit Prompt not showing actual prompt, and no creative opt-in options. Below are all 4 changes needed. Apply them all together.

### CHANGE 1: Replace entire `/app/api/photos/[id]/enhance/route.ts`

### CHANGE 2: Add `uploadBufferToS3` function to `/lib/s3.ts`

Add this new exported function at the bottom of the file, BEFORE the closing of the file (after the `deleteFile` function):

```typescript
export async function uploadBufferToS3(
  buffer: Buffer,
  fileName: string,
  contentType: string
): Promise<string> {
  const timestamp = Date.now();
  const sanitizedFileName = fileName.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9._-]/g, "_");
  const cloud_storage_path = `${folderPrefix}public/enhanced/${timestamp}-${sanitizedFileName}`;

  const command = new PutObjectCommand({
    Bucket: bucketName,
    Key: cloud_storage_path,
    Body: buffer,
    ContentType: contentType,
    ContentDisposition: "inline",
  });

  await s3Client.send(command);
  return cloud_storage_path;
}
```

---

### CHANGE 3: Replace entire `/lib/enhancement-prompts.ts`

Delete ALL content in this file and replace with the following. These prompts use an editing/correction style that works well with gpt-image-1.5 — they tell the model to EDIT the existing photo rather than regenerate it. Creative additions (towels, toilet paper) are NOT in the base prompts — they are opt-in checkboxes in the admin UI.

```typescript
export const ROOM_PROMPTS: Record<string, string> = {
  Kitchen: `Edit this existing photo of a real kitchen in a vacation rental property. Keep the exact same scene, composition, objects, and details — do not add, remove, or change any items, furniture, fixtures, or architectural features. This is a real space that guests will visit, so accuracy is critical.

Apply professional real estate photo editing:
- Correct white balance so surfaces show their true colors
- Even out lighting — brighten shadows, recover blown-out windows
- Straighten vertical lines (cabinets, door frames, appliances)
- Correct any wide-angle or perspective distortion from camera lens
- Sharpen details on appliances, fixtures, and hardware
- Stainless steel should look neutral and clean (not yellow or blue)

### CHANGE 4: Update the admin submission detail page `/app/admin/submissions/[id]/page.tsx`

There are several changes needed to this file. Apply them all:

#### 4A. Add new state variables and the `buildCurrentPrompt` helper

Find the existing state declarations (around lines 56-73) and ADD these new state variables after `resolvedUrls`:

```typescript
const [showPromptEditor, setShowPromptEditor] = useState(false);
const [customPrompt, setCustomPrompt] = useState('');
```

Also update the `enhanceSettings` state to include the new creative addition fields:

```typescript
const [enhanceSettings, setEnhanceSettings] = useState({
  intensity: 'Moderate',
  skyReplacement: false,
  bedFixing: false,
  windowRecovery: false,
  brightness: false,
  perspective: false,
  reflection: false,
  additionalNotes: '',
  addTowels: false,
  smoothLinens: false,
  addToiletPaper: false
});
```

Then add this helper function AFTER the `getResolvedUrl` function (around line 159). This function builds the ACTUAL prompt that would be sent to the API, matching the server-side logic exactly:

```typescript
const buildCurrentPrompt = (): string => {
  if (!selectedPhoto) return '';
  
  // Import these at the top of the file: import { ROOM_PROMPTS, INTENSITY_MODIFIERS } from "@/lib/enhancement-prompts";
  const roomKey = selectedPhoto.subCategory || selectedPhoto.roomCategory;
  let prompt = ROOM_PROMPTS[roomKey] || ROOM_PROMPTS[selectedPhoto.roomCategory] || ROOM_PROMPTS["Kitchen"];
  prompt += INTENSITY_MODIFIERS[enhanceSettings.intensity] || INTENSITY_MODIFIERS["Moderate"];

  const toggles: string[] = [];
  if (enhanceSettings.skyReplacement) toggles.push("Replace the sky with a pleasant blue sky with natural clouds.");
  if (enhanceSettings.bedFixing) toggles.push("Smooth and fix bed linens to appear crisp, clean, and hotel-quality.");
  if (enhanceSettings.windowRecovery) toggles.push("Recover blown-out windows to reveal the exterior view.");
  if (enhanceSettings.brightness) toggles.push("Increase overall brightness and open up shadow areas.");
  if (enhanceSettings.perspective) toggles.push("Correct perspective distortion and straighten vertical lines.");
  if (enhanceSettings.reflection) toggles.push("Remove photographer reflections from mirrors, glass, and screens.");
  if (enhanceSettings.addTowels) toggles.push("Add fresh, neatly folded white towels if towels are missing or sparse.");
  if (enhanceSettings.smoothLinens) toggles.push("Smooth bed linens and duvet to appear freshly made and wrinkle-free.");
  if (enhanceSettings.addToiletPaper) toggles.push("Add a toilet paper roll if one is not visible.");

  if (toggles.length > 0) {
    prompt += `\n\nADDITIONAL SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:\n${toggles.join('\n')}`;
  }

  if (enhanceSettings.additionalNotes) {
    prompt += `\n\nADMIN NOTES:\n${enhanceSettings.additionalNotes}`;
  }

  return prompt;
};
```

**IMPORTANT**: Add this import at the top of the file with the other imports:

```typescript
import { ROOM_PROMPTS, INTENSITY_MODIFIERS } from "@/lib/enhancement-prompts";
```

#### 4B. Replace the `handleEnhance` function

Replace the entire `handleEnhance` function (lines 161-204) with this simplified version that uses JSON instead of streaming:

```typescript
const handleEnhance = async () => {
  if (!selectedPhoto) return;
  setEnhancing(true);

  try {
    const body: Record<string, unknown> = { ...enhanceSettings };
    
    // If the user edited the prompt, send it as customPrompt
    if (showPromptEditor && customPrompt.trim()) {
      body.customPrompt = customPrompt.trim();
    }

    const response = await fetch(`/api/photos/${selectedPhoto.id}/enhance`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(body)
    });

    const result = await response.json();

    if (response.ok && result?.status === 'completed') {
      // Update the selected photo immediately with new enhanced URL
      setSelectedPhoto(prev => prev ? { ...prev, enhancedUrl: result.enhancedUrl, status: 'Enhanced' } : null);
      // Then refresh full submission data
      await fetchSubmission();
    } else {
      const errorMsg = result?.error || 'Enhancement failed';
      alert(errorMsg);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Enhancement failed:', error);
    alert('Enhancement failed. Please try again.');
  } finally {
    setEnhancing(false);
    setShowPromptEditor(false);
  }
};
```

#### 4C. Add Creative Additions checkboxes and Edit Prompt UI

In the Enhancement Settings section of the JSX, find the toggles grid (the section with skyReplacement, windowRecovery, etc.) and ADD the following two new sections AFTER the existing toggles grid and BEFORE the "Additional notes" textarea:

**Creative Additions section** (add right after the closing `</div>` of the toggles grid):

```jsx
{/* Creative Additions */}
<div>
  <label className="text-sm font-medium text-amber-700 mb-2 block">Creative Additions (opt-in)</label>
  <div className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 gap-3">
    {[
      { key: 'addTowels', label: 'Add Towels', hint: 'Bathroom only' },
      { key: 'smoothLinens', label: 'Smooth Linens', hint: 'Bedroom only' },
      { key: 'addToiletPaper', label: 'Add Toilet Paper', hint: 'Bathroom only' },
    ].map(({ key, label, hint }) => (
      <label
        key={key}
        className="flex items-center gap-2 p-2 rounded-lg bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 cursor-pointer hover:bg-amber-100"
      >
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={enhanceSettings[key as keyof typeof enhanceSettings] as boolean}
          onChange={(e) => setEnhanceSettings(prev => ({ ...prev, [key]: e.target.checked }))}
          className="rounded text-amber-600"
        />
        <div>
          <span className="text-sm">{label}</span>
          <span className="text-xs text-amber-600 ml-1">({hint})</span>
        </div>
      </label>
    ))}
  </div>
</div>
```

**Edit Prompt section** (add right after the Creative Additions section):

```jsx
{/* Edit Prompt */}
<div>
  <button
    onClick={() => {
      if (!showPromptEditor) {
        // When opening, populate with the ACTUAL current prompt
        setCustomPrompt(buildCurrentPrompt());
      }
      setShowPromptEditor(!showPromptEditor);
    }}
    className="text-sm text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline"
  >
    {showPromptEditor ? 'Hide prompt editor' : 'Edit prompt'}
  </button>
  {showPromptEditor && (
    <div className="mt-2 space-y-2">
      <textarea
        value={customPrompt}
        onChange={(e) => setCustomPrompt(e.target.value)}
        className="w-full border border-blue-200 rounded-lg px-3 py-2 text-sm font-mono"
        rows={12}
        placeholder="Custom enhancement prompt..."
      />
      <div className="flex gap-2">
        <button
          onClick={() => setCustomPrompt(buildCurrentPrompt())}
          className="text-xs text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-700 underline"
        >
          Reset to current defaults
        </button>
        <span className="text-xs text-gray-400">|</span>
        <span className="text-xs text-gray-400">{customPrompt.length} chars</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  )}
</div>
```

#### 4D. Update the Enhance button text for "Enhancing" status

Find the enhance button JSX and update the disabled/loading state to also handle the "Enhancing" status from the database. The button should show a spinner when `enhancing` is true:

The existing button is fine as-is, but update the disabled condition:

```jsx
<button
  onClick={handleEnhance}
  disabled={enhancing || selectedPhoto?.status === 'Enhancing'}
  className="w-full flex items-center justify-center gap-2 px-4 py-3 bg-[#383D31] text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-[#2a2e24] disabled:opacity-50"
>
```

### CHANGE 5: One-time stale URL cleanup

Some photos in the database may have `enhancedUrl` values pointing to external URLs (like `lh3.googleusercontent.com`) from previous enhancement attempts with flux-kontext. These cause CORS errors. Run this SQL against the production database ONE TIME to clean them up:

```sql
UPDATE "Photo" 
SET "enhancedUrl" = NULL, "status" = 'Pending' 
WHERE "enhancedUrl" IS NOT NULL 
AND "enhancedUrl" LIKE 'http%';
```

Or if you prefer, create a temporary API route at `/app/api/admin/cleanup-stale-urls/route.ts`:

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { prisma } from "@/lib/db";
import { getServerSession } from "next-auth";
import { authOptions } from "@/lib/auth-options";

export async function POST() {
  const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
  if (!session) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
  }

  const result = await prisma.photo.updateMany({
    where: {
      enhancedUrl: { startsWith: "http" }
    },
    data: {
      enhancedUrl: null,
      status: "Pending"
    }
  });

  return NextResponse.json({ cleaned: result.count });
}
```

Call it once via `POST /api/admin/cleanup-stale-urls`, then delete the file.

### SUMMARY OF ALL CHANGES:

1. **`/app/api/photos/[id]/enhance/route.ts`** — Complete rewrite: uses `gpt-image-1.5` (not gpt-5.1), synchronous JSON (not streaming), re-uploads to S3 (fixes CORS), 90s timeout with AbortController, supports `customPrompt` parameter, supports creative addition params (`addTowels`, `smoothLinens`, `addToiletPaper`)

2. **`/lib/s3.ts`** — Added `uploadBufferToS3()` function for re-uploading enhanced images to our own S3

3. **`/lib/enhancement-prompts.ts`** — Complete rewrite of all prompts: editing/correction style instead of generative style, room-specific texture hints, Lightroom-style intensity modifiers, added fallback keys for parent categories ("Living Spaces", "Exterior")

4. **`/app/admin/submissions/[id]/page.tsx`** — New features: `buildCurrentPrompt()` helper that mirrors server logic, "Edit prompt" button shows ACTUAL prompt being used (not a generic placeholder), amber "Creative Additions" checkbox section, JSON-based `handleEnhance` (no streaming), auto-refresh after enhancement, `customPrompt` sent to API when prompt editor is used

5. **One-time DB cleanup** — Clear stale external URLs from previous enhancement attempts
